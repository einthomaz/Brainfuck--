++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ --  ->   Sets the ammount of numbers to generate (minus 2 for the already existing 2).
>++ -> Sets the ammount of numbers already generated in register 2.
>+/ -> Sets the number in register 3 to 1 (first fibonacci number) and prints it.
>+/ -> Sets the number in register 4 to 1 (second fibonacci number) and prints it.
<<#< -> Stores the number from register 2 and goes to register 1.
[ -> Opens a loop until the number in register 1 is 0.
    >& -> Goes to register 2 and jumps the stored number of registers to the right. (Now in register 4)
    [>+>+<<-] -> Copies the value from register 4 to register 5 and register 6.
    >>[<<+>>-] -> Copies the register 6 to register 4.
    <<<[>>+>+<<<-] -> Copies the value from register 3 to register 5 and register 6.
    >>>[<<<+>>>-]</> -> Copies the value from register 6 to register 3.
    << -> Goes to register 4
    %+#<- -> Jumps sotred number of registers to the left, adds 1, stores the value, and subtracts 1 from the first register.
] -> repeated, until the number in register 1 is 0.
